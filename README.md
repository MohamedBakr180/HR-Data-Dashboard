# HR Compensation , Recruitment & Attrition Data Dashboard 
## Project Overview 
Power BI dashboard analyzing HR data to identify and prioritize key risks (pay equity, attrition, and low satisfaction) for recruitment and retention strategy
This project is a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze a sample HR dataset and provide actionable insights into organizational health, with a specific focus on areas that impact Compensation & recruitment strategy and employee retention.
The goal of this dashboard is to move beyond static reporting by allowing HR consultants and business leaders to:
1.  Quickly identify job roles at the highest risk for attrition due to compensation issues.
2.  Prioritize strategic recruitment efforts (e.g., targeted salary benchmarking for high-risk roles).
3.  Monitor key workforce health indicators, such as pay equity and job satisfaction.
##  Key Findings & Strategic Insights
The following insights are derived from the dashboard visualizations and represent critical areas where a recruitment intern can add immediate value by assisting clients with targeted talent acquisition:
### 1. High-Risk Attrition due to Pay Inequity
**Severe Underpayment:** **19.53%** of the entire workforce is flagged as **Underpaid**[cite: 102, 107]. This signals a systemic problem that will result in persistent backfilling requirements for the recruitment team.
**Critical Retention Risk:** The two roles identified as being the most significantly underpaid high-value positions are the **Research Director** (\$17.3K under market) and the **Healthcare Representative** (\$16.1K under market). *Recruitment must proactively pipeline talent for these positions.*

### 2. Organizational Dissatisfaction
* A significant portion of the workforce (over 27%) is classified as **Dissatisfied** or **Strongly Dissatisfied**
* This low satisfaction creates a weak **Employer Brand**, making talent acquisition harder and increasing the importance of a compelling, positive recruitment pitch.

### 3. Diversity Opportunity
* The overall employee base shows a gender imbalance (854 Male vs. 569 Female). The largest department is **Research & Development** (924 employees)
* *Recruitment efforts should incorporate a strategic focus on diversity sourcing* to balance the workforce composition, especially when hiring for the large R&D department.

##  Technical Details & Tools

* **Visualization & Reporting:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* **Data Modeling:** Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated measures (e.g., Pay Status, Pay Equity Deviation) to enable dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis.
* **Design Principles:** Utilized clear color-coding (red for risk, blue for analysis) and consistent chart selection to maximize the **time-to-insight* for the user.

##  Files Included
* `HR_Dataset.csv` - The anonymized raw data used for the analysis.
* `HR_project.pdf` - High-resolution static export of the complete dashboard for easy viewing.
* `HR_Dashboard.pbix` - The original Power BI Desktop file (requires Power BI Desktop to open).
